  # dnssec-no-timecheck
  # DNSSEC signatures are only valid for specified time windows, and should
  # be rejected outside those windows. This generates an interesting
  # chicken-and-egg problem for machines which don't have a hardware real
  # time clock. For these machines to determine the correct time typically
  # requires use of NTP and therefore DNS, but validating DNS requires that
  # the correct time is already known. Setting this flag removes the
  # time-window checks (but not other DNSSEC validation.) only until the
  # dnsmasq process receives SIGHUP. The intention is that dnsmasq should
  # be started with this flag when the platform determines that reliable
  # time is not currently available. As soon as reliable time is
  # established, a SIGHUP should be sent to dnsmasq, which enables time
  # checking, and purges the cache of DNS records which have not been
  # throughly checked.

  # The ntp-wait program blocks until ntpd is in synchronized state. This
  # can be useful at boot time, to delay the boot sequence until after
  # "ntpd -g" has set the time.
